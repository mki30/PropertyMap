                <p>
                    <strong><strong></strong></strong>A home loan is sanctioned to the NRIs for any of the following housing finance schemes:<br>
                    a) To purchase a house that is ready-built, under construction or from a second owner<br>
                    b) To fund the purchase of a plot of land allotted by a society / development authority.<br>

                <p><strong>What is the eligibility for obtaining NRI Home Loans?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Your eligibility is calculated in the same way as it is calculated for resident Indians. More emphasis is laid on the following criteria in the appraisal of a NRI case:<br>
                    a) Qualifications – the NRI applicant has to be a graduate<br>
                    b) Current job profile &amp; Past work experience<br>
                    c) Probability of continuing abroad for the loan tenure<br>
                    d) Probability of servicing the loan with an extended tenure in case you have to return to India.

                <p><strong>What is the repayment period for a NRI Home Loan?</strong></p>
                <p>The housing finance offered to NRIs normally does not exceed 15 years. The repayment for the loan is via EMIs. The EMIs begin only after the entire loan is disbursed. In case of a part disbursement, you pay simple interest at the rate applicable on the loan amount that is disbursed to you.</p>
                <p><strong>How is the mode of payment for NRI home loans?</strong></p>
                <p>The loan towards the house has to be paid for the entire tenure of the loan through remittances from abroad through normal banking channels or from such accounts as may be permitted by RBI from time to time. As of today, the payments are done through NRO, NRE, NRNR and FCNR accounts. These accounts change on the basis of RBI permissions to each HFC.</p>
                <p><strong>What are the Tax Benefits applicable to Non-Resident Indians?</strong></p>
                <p>No tax benefits are available for NRI customers unless you file returns and thereby become eligible to avail the tax benefits as mentioned under Home Loans.</p>
                <p><strong>What are the documents required for obtaining Home Loans for NRIs &amp; POIs?</strong></p>
                <p>NRIs are required to submit additional documents than is normally required for a resident Indian.</p>
                <p>a) A copy of the passport</p>
                <p>b) A copy of the works contract (also sometimes referred to as the contract card/labor card)</p>
                <p>c) The power of attorney (POA). The POA is required because the borrower is not based in India and in such a scenario; the HFC would need a representative ‘in lieu of’ the NRI to deal with as required. Although not mandatory, the POA is usually drawn on the NRIs parents, wife or children</p>
