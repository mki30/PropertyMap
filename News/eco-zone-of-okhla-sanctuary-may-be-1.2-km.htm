        NEW DELHI:The official committee appointed by environment ministry has now suggested that the eco zone of okhla bird sanctury may be reduced to 1.2 kilometer,that is considerably smaller that previously declared by  National Wildlife Board (NWB),that is 10km radius around the sanctury.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three-member committee comprising forest officials from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments and the environment ministry, constituted on June 11, undertook a field visit to the area to make a determination of the eco-sensitive zone on June 27.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their report recommends a 1.2 km area between the northern boundary of the bird sanctuary and the DND flyover as the eco-sensitive zone. The committee observed the wetlant and found that the distance of 1.2km and DND flyover serves as a "barrier" breaking the continuity of wetland so it would be appropriate to limit the zone till the DND flyover.
    </p>
    <p>
        This move will bring relief to the nearly 450,000 home owners and builder who have invested huge amount aof money.
    
        The report has been submitted to the environment ministry and source indicated that notification would be issued soon.
